Hello, I have completed the challenge..

I have built this app using the following technologies:

Backend:
-> Nodejs
-> Expressjs

Database:
-> MongoDB

FrontEnd:
-> Angular 1.5x
-> SCSS
-> Bootstrap 3

Few Libraries used:
-> body-parser: to use form data submitted while registration and login
-> connect-flash: to implement flash messages for better UX
-> request: to trigger http request to fetch csv file
-> mongoose: Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model our application data
-> cors: to enable Cross-origin resource sharing (for development purpose)
-> passport: To support authentication in a standard way

I know that I was supposed to use Angular 2 for this project. However I have not tried it before.
So I have chosen to complete this project using Angular 1. I really hope my work will be considered and
I promise I will start learning Angular 2
